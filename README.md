# Ruby_Pricise_Heap_Spray
Use ruby strings to do a precise heap spray in an win7 env
ps. 0c0c0c0c
the script works the only issue is on how ruby behaves. basically you will have to adjust the last number of iterations on how many times u call the spray function. that's bc of how ruby works.... basically ruby decides to delete all heap allocs of certain sizes if for that respective size it's 100% usage of that size ðŸ™‚
